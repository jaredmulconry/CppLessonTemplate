# CppLessonTemplate
"Built on top of CMake, this project includes tests for the compilation environment to check feature support, 
as well as an exercise folder for each exercise."

This repository is meant as the starting point for a series of lessons on C++ I want to produce.
It is a CMake project, to provide separation between students and the build environment, as well as making lessons less focused
on the differences between various platforms.
In order to catch unsupported compilers early, there is a suite of tests that attempts to compile various programs that take 
advantage of newer features.
The exercise folder is to be filled with a particular example, either by the teacher or by the student.
